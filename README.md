# hello-world

A ["Hello, World!" program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program, and as such is often the very first program people write. 

> While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, world!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal book [*The C Programming Language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)). The example program from that book prints "hello, world" (without capital letters or exclamation mark), and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan), *Programming in C: A Tutorial*:

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main( )
    {
        printf("hello, world.\n");
        return 0;
    }

Since then, "Hello, World!" has been implemented in just about every programming language on the planet. [Here](http://helloworldcollection.de/) is a collection includes 579 Hello World programs in as many more-or-less well known programming languages, plus 78 human languages.
